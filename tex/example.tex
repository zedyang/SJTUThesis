\subsection{Unordered List}
\label{sec:unorderlist}

The aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness was indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings. The odour rising from the newly opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared Hawkins thought he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and everyone was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness.

Poor Johansen's handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of the six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant. The Thing cannot be described - there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and what an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by accident. After vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.

Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has shielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant sailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise.

Loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men. A time will come - but I must not and cannot think! Let me pray that, if I do not survive this manuscript, my executors may put caution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye. 

\begin {multline}
  \frac {1}{2}\Delta (f_{ij}f^{ij})=
  2\left (\sum _{i<j}\chi _{ij}(\sigma _{i}-
    \sigma _{j}) ^{2}+ f^{ij}\nabla _{j}\nabla _{i}(\Delta f)+\right .\\
  \left .+\nabla _{k}f_{ij}\nabla ^{k}f^{ij}+

\label{sec:depth4}

Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has shielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant sailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. 

\begin{displaymath}
    A \xleftarrow[n=0]{} B \xrightarrow[LongLongLongLong]{n>0} C 
\end{displaymath}

\begin{eqnarray}
  f(x) & \xleftrightarrow[]{A=B}  & B \\
  & \xleftharpoondown[below]{above} & B \nonumber \\
  & \xLeftrightarrow[below]{above} & B
\end{eqnarray}

And:

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:none}
  & I(X_3;X_4)-I(X_3;X_4\mid{}X_1)-I(X_3;X_4\mid{}X_2) \nonumber \\

The aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness was indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings.

\begin{thm}[fhtagn]
\label{thm:res}
  Assume $U$ is a Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn on complex space，$a_1,\ldots,a_n$R'lyeh wgah'nagl points，$f$ is defined on $U\backslash \{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.
  If $\gamma$ is a curve that Ph'nglui mglw'nafh $a_1,\ldots,a_n$, whose Ph'nglui mglw'nafh but not $a_k$ fhtagn, then

  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:res}
    \ointop_{\gamma}f(z)\,\mathrm{d}z = 2\uppi\mathbf{i}\sum^n_{k=1}\mathrm{I}(\gamma,a_k)\mathrm{Res}(f,a_k)
  \end{equation}

  If $\gamma$ is a Jordan fhtagn，then $\mathrm{I}(\gamma, a_k)=1$, therefore 

  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:resthm}
    \ointop_{\gamma}f(z)\,\mathrm{d}z = 2\uppi\mathbf{i}\sum^n_{k=1}\mathrm{Res}(f,a_k)
  \end{equation}

      % \oint_\gamma f(z)\, dz = 2\pi i \sum_{k=1}^n \mathrm{Res}(f, a_k ).
